# Modified MNIST Challenge 

This project is a collaboration with Carl Perreault-Lafleur and Khoren Ponsin.

The goal of this project is to implement a model that predicts the highest value digit in an image containing three
randomly placed, randomly rotated MNIST digits in a gray-scale image. The models were used to participate in a Kaggle
Competition titled â€œModified MNIST". The goal of this competition was to achieve the top prediction accuracy score on
a provided test dataset. Through a variety experiments used to tune hyperparameters and determine the top performing
neural network architecture, we arrived at a model which achieved a test accuracy score of 96.033%. 

Our results are summarized in the following:

- The notebook 'Digit_Split_Model' contains all the results for the Intuitive Approach part of the project.
- The notebook 'Double_Data' contains the code used to run the 4 layers CNN on the doubled dataset.
- The creation of the additional images can be done using the following ressources: https://github.com/shaohua0116/MultiDigitMNIST
- The notebooks 'Modified_VGG-16vsVGG-16' and 'Project_3_ml_vgg16' contain all the results for the VGG-16 part of the project.
- The notebooks 'Project_3_ml_tuning_lr_0_0001', and 'Project_3_ml_tuning_lr_0_00005' contain all the results for the Tuning the Learning Rate part of the project.
- The notebooks 'Batch_Size_Tuning' contain all the results for the Tuning the Batch Size part of the project.
